    "# Lab 2: Quantum teleportation\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to this lab on quantum teleportation in which you'll solve a problem that Alice and Bob have been having. Relax, it's not a relationship problem! Alice possesses a qubit in an unknown state $\\lvert \\psi \\rangle$ and she wishes to transfer this quantum state to Bob. However, they are very far apart and lack any means to transfer quantum information directly, only classical information. Is it possible to achieve their goal?\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that if Alice and Bob share an entangled qubit pair, she can transfer her qubit state to Bob by sending two bits of classical information. This process is known as teleportation because, at the end, Bob will possess |ψ⟩, and Alice will no longer have it."

    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum teleportation is a protocol that allows the transfer of quantum information from one qubit to another using entanglement and classical communication. It was proposed by Charles Bennett, Gilles Brassard, Claude Crépeau, Richard Jozsa, Asher Peres, and William Wootters in 1993. The process does not transmit the qubit itself but rather transfers the quantum state from the source qubit to the target qubit.\n",
    "\n",
    "The protocol requires three qubits:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The qubit to be teleported (Alice's qubit)\n",
    "2. One half of an entangled pair of qubits (Alice's second qubit)\n",
    "3. The other half of the entangled pair (Bob's qubit)\n",
    "\n",
    "The protocol can be summarized in the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create an entangled pair of qubits (Bell pair) shared between Alice and Bob.\n",
    "2. Alice performs a Bell basis measurement on her two qubits.\n",
    "3. Alice sends the classical results of her measurement to Bob.\n",
    "4. Bob applies appropriate quantum gates based on Alice's measurement results to obtain the teleported state."

    "## Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to transfer a quantum bit, Alice and Bob require the help of a third party who provides them with a pair of entangled qubits. Next, Alice carries out certain operations on her qubit and shares the results with Bob through a classical communication channel. Finally, Bob performs a series of operations on his end to successfully obtain Alice's qubit. Now, let's delve deeper into each of these steps."
