    "# Lab 3: Iterative phase estimation\n",
    "\n",
    "The quantum phase estimation (QPE) algorithm is one of the most important and famous quantum algorithms. It is a key subroutine of Shor's factoring algorithm, as well as algorithms for quantum simulation. The textbook version of the algorithm uses a number of auxiliary qubits which scales with the desired precision, leading to circuits that are challenging to execute on today's noisy devices with limited qubit number and connectivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Iterative phase estimation (IPE) is a variant of QPE which requires only one auxiliary qubit. In IPE, the auxiliary qubit is repeatedly measured, with the measurement results used to guide future quantum operations. Until the introduction of dynamic circuits, such classical feed-forward was impossible to execute on IBM's quantum hardware.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we will use the recently introduced dynamic circuits capabilities to implement IPE."

    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Like any phase estimation algorithm, IPE is designed to solve the following problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem statement:** Given a unitary matrix $U$ and an eigenstate $|\\Psi\\rangle$ of $U$ with an unknown eigenvalue $e^{i 2\\pi \\varphi}$, estimate the value of $\\varphi$.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few important details need to be clarified in this problem statement, namely, how $U$ and $|\\Psi\\rangle$ are specified. We assume that $U$ is given as a quantum circuit implementing $U$, and in fact, we assume we have the ability to efficiently implement the operations *controlled*-$U^{2^t}$ for positive integers $t$.\n",
    "This is the same assumption used in the original QPE algorithm.\n",
    "The eigenstate is also given as a quantum circuit: we assume we have the ability to efficiently prepare $|\\Psi\\rangle$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's first assume for simplicity that $\\varphi$ can have an exact binary expansion, that is, it can be written as\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\varphi = \\varphi_1/2 + \\varphi_2/4 + \\cdots + \\varphi_m/2^m = 0.\\varphi_1 \\varphi_2 \\cdots \\varphi_m\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where in the final equality we are using \"decimal\" point notation in base 2.\n",
    "For simplicity, suppose $U$ is a unitary operator acting on one qubit (everything we say here also applies to the case where $U$ acts on multiple qubits). Since IPE requires an auxiliary qubit, we need a system of two qubits, $q_0$ and $q_1$, where $q_0$ is the auxiliary qubit and $q_1$ represents the physical system on which $U$ operates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, suppose that we initialize $q_0$ in the state $|+\\rangle = \\frac{|0\\rangle + |1\\rangle}{\\sqrt{2}}$ and $q_1$ in the state $|\\Psi \\rangle$.\n",
    "What happens if we apply the *controlled*-$U^{2^t}$ gate, with $q_0$ being the control and $q_1$ being the target?\n",
    "Since $|\\Psi \\rangle$ is an eigenstate of $U$ with eigenvalue $e^{i 2\\pi \\varphi}$, we have\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "|+\\rangle |\\Psi \\rangle &= \\left(\\frac{|0\\rangle + |1\\rangle}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right) |\\Psi \\rangle \\\\\n",

    "\\end{align}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "That is, the state of the system qubit remains unchanged, while a phase of $e^{i 2 \\pi 2^{t} \\varphi}$ has been \"kicked back\" into the state of the auxiliary qubit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, note that\n",
    "$$\n",
    "e^{i 2 \\pi 2^{t} \\varphi} = e^{i 2 \\pi 2^{t} (0.\\varphi_1 \\varphi_2 \\cdots \\varphi_m)}\n",

    "= e^{i 2 \\pi (0. \\varphi_{t + 1} \\cdots \\varphi_m)},\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where in the last equality, the whole number part of the \"decimal\" representation of the phase has disappeared because $e^{i 2\\pi n} = 1$ for any integer $n$.\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "- for $t=0$, the phase would be $e^{i 2 \\pi 2^{0} \\varphi} = e^{i 2 \\pi \\varphi} = e^{i 2 \\pi 0.\\varphi_1 \\varphi_2 ... \\varphi_m}$\n",
    "- for $t=1$, the phase would be $e^{i 2 \\pi 2^{1} \\varphi}= e^{i 2 \\pi \\varphi_1} e^{i 2 \\pi 0.\\varphi_2 \\varphi_3 ... \\varphi_m} = e^{i 2 \\pi 0.\\varphi_2 \\varphi_3 ... \\varphi_m}$\n",
    "- for $t=2$, the phase would be $e^{i 2 \\pi 2^{2} \\varphi} = e^{i 2 \\pi 0.\\varphi_3 \\varphi_4 ... \\varphi_m}$\n",
    "- for $t=m-1$, the phase would be $e^{i 2 \\pi 2^{m-1} \\varphi} = e^{i 2 \\pi 0.\\varphi_m}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last case where $t = m - 1$, the phase is $e^{i 2 \\pi 0.\\varphi_m}$, which is equal to $1$ if $\\varphi_m = 0$ and $-1$ if $\\varphi_m = 1$.\n",
    "In the first case, the auxiliary qubit $q_0$ would be in the state $|+\\rangle = \\frac{|0\\rangle + |1\\rangle}{\\sqrt{2}}$, and in the second case it would be\n",
    "in the state $|-\\rangle = \\frac{|0\\rangle - |1\\rangle}{\\sqrt{2}}$. Therefore, measuring the qubit in the Pauli $X$ basis would distinguish these cases with a 100\\% success rate.\n",
    "This is done by performing a Hadamard gate on the qubit before measuring it. In the first case we would measure 0 and in the second case we would measure 1;\n",
    "in other words, the measured bit would be equal to $\\varphi_m$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first step of the IPE algorithm, we directly measure the least significant bit of the phase $\\varphi$, $\\varphi_m$, by initializing the 2-qubit registers as described above ( $q_0 \\rightarrow |+\\rangle$ and $q_1 \\rightarrow |\\Psi \\rangle$ ), performing a *controlled*-$U^{2^{m-1}}$ operation, and measuring $q_0$ in the Pauli $X$ basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "in the second step, we initialize the systems in the same way and apply a *controlled*-$U^{2^{m-2}}$ operation. The relative phase in $q_0$ after these operations is now $e^{i 2 \\pi 0.\\varphi_{m-1}\\varphi_{m}}= e^{i 2 \\pi 0.\\varphi_{m-1}} e^{i 2 \\pi \\varphi_m/4}$. \n",
    "To extract the phase bit $\\varphi_{m-1}$, first perform a phase correction by rotating around the $Z$-axis by an angle $-2 \\pi \\varphi_m/4=-\\pi \\varphi_m/2$, which results in the state of  $q_0$ to be $|0\\rangle + e^{i 2 \\pi 0.\\varphi_{m-1}} | 1 \\rangle$. Perform a measurement on $q_0$ in the Pauli $X$ basis to obtain the phase bit $\\varphi_{m-1}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the $k$-th step of the IPE, getting $\\varphi_{m-k+1}$, consists of the register initialization ($q_0$ in $|+\\rangle$, $q_1$ in $|\\Psi\\rangle$), the application of a *controlled*-$U^{2^{m-k}}$, a rotation around $Z$ of angle $\\omega_k = -2 \\pi 0.0\\varphi_{m-k+2} ... \\varphi_m$, and a measurement of $q_0$ in the Pauli $X$ basis: a Hadamard transform to $q_0$, and a measurement of $q_0$ in the computational basis. Note that $q_1$ remains in the state $|\\Psi\\rangle$ throughout the algorithm."
